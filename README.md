# Multimodality_M2TAL
Materiel for the Multimodality course for M2 TAL students at IMDC.

The exercise notebook is largely inspired by the Classifying Multimodal Data Using Transformers tutorial at KDD 2022 (Watson W.K. Chua, Lu Li, and Alvina Goh. 2022. Classifying Multimodal Data Using Transformers. In Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '22). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 4780â€“4781. https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3542634).
